 * The <CODE>BridgeConfig</CODE> represents the set of values a portlet can configure for a given bridge instance. Currently, by
 * spec, the portlet passes most of this configuration to the bridge using <CODE>PortletContext</CODE> attributes. The bridge,
 * in its <code>init()</code> method, is responsible for packaging all this configuration information into a BridgeConfig. It
 * must then only reference such configuration information from this object. I.e. it no longer makes reference to the
 * <CODE>PortletContext</CODE> attributes. This allows replaceable pieces of the bridge implementation to always have a
 * consistent object to retrieve configuration information from.
